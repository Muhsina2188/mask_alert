First Phase(Real Time face mask detection) of discussion
Drawbacks:
1.The awareness to wear the mask was not given.
2.Only able to give the count of people who are not wearing the mask

Second Phase of discussion
Planned to add something more to face mask detection like an app to store details of customers.
After analysing the changing situations of Covid in our country ,we came into the conclusion that MASK is the most important thing.
So we sticked to the face mask detection majorly in organisations like schools and colleges

Third phase of discussion
Added an alert system (app) for students .
whenever a person in that particular organisation is not wearing the mask they will get the notification and admin can see the count of people not wearing the mask.
